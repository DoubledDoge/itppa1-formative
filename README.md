# ITPPA1-B44 Assignment

This repository contains my formative assignment for the ITPPA1-B44 module at my university. It also is officialy my very first GitHub-repository. It is currently archived.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main folders, each corresponding to a question in the assignment:

- Question1/
- Question2/
- Question3/
- Question4/

Alongside these, there are several files scattered around, as well as a subfolder inside Question 2 called Flowcharts, where all of my flowcharts are organised as .png files.

## Releases

I'll personally have some few releases which will only show the .exe files front and center for my own contentment. I believe the current release will be the last I'll make of the project, but if there were any hypothetical changes made to its files for whatever reason, a release will immediately follow.

You can find the current release here:

## Contents

This repository as a whole contains:
- C++ source-code files
- Executable Files for the source-code files
- A flowchart (Question 2)
- An pseudocode algorithm (Question 2)
- A bibliography containing all my sources

Note that the only thing missing is my main project document, which I prefer to keep by myself for the time being. There is a very slim chance I'll even upload it onto here, as I would still like to keep some of my work private. Just know that it is mostly more relevant towards the course and university associated with this project.

## Completion

This project is now 100% completed. Currently, it is left semi-abandoned as I have no further desires to refine the project more than I should. Since its open souce, you are more than free to use this for your own purposes.

## Note

This repository has been made private before to preserve the integrity of my own work, but is now obviously made public. Right now, I have no desires to continue on this project any further, and some of the source code is very much representative of my junior programming skills. I have been able to further refine it in the future, but I prefer it to be left alone as a piece of my personal history. It is my first repository, after all.

If there are any questions you may have about this repository, feel free to contact me at any time. I'd be glad to help you.
