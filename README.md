# ITPPA1-B44 Assignment

This repository contains my formative assignment for the ITPPA1-B44 module at my university. It also is officialy my very first GitHub-repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main folders, each corresponding to a question in the assignment:

- Question1/
- Question2/
- Question3/
- Question4/

## Releases

I'll personally have some few releases which will only show the .exe files front and center for my own contentment. Be sure that this repository will be archived as soon as the project is deemed 100% completed. 

You can find the current release here:
